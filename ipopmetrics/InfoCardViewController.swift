We can scan the people and businesses that folow your account, and then analyze who follows them. With this information we can better identify the same groups of people you and your competition are marketing towards. Popmetrics also identifies the types of content you and your followers share, like and generally engage with on Twitter. We use this engagement metric to determine the best content to post."
